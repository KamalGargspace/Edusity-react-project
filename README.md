# React + Vite

This project is a frontend application built using React, Vite, and CSS. It provides a minimal yet efficient setup for creating dynamic and reactive websites with Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and ESLint configurations.

## Features
- Fast and optimized development with Vite
- React framework for building interactive user interfaces
- ESLint for maintaining code quality
- Hot Module Replacement (HMR) for a seamless development experience

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

## Expanding the ESLint Configuration
If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript and enabling type-aware lint rules. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
